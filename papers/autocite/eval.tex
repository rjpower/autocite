\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Test Corpus}
We compiled our sample corpus documents using the contents of 
the 2008 and 2010 OSDI conferences as \emph{seed} documents.  We then extracted 
all references from these documents and attempted to download the target 
papers.  In this manner we acquired a set of \corpussize documents for 
evaluation.

\subsection{Evaluation Metric}

We evaluated the performance of our retrieval algorithms for a document using 
the most natural criteria - the document's actual references.  To minimize
trivial exact matches (e.g. based on title and authors) we stripped the 
reference section of each document prior to checking for matches.
