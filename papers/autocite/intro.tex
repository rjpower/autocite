\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Every academic author has spent countless hours researching and compiling
references for papers.  The ultimate task of deciding the exact
set of references for a draft paper requires a good deal of judgement and
knowledge of the area.  Our goal with this project is not to completely 
automate this activity, but rather to simplify this process and reduce
the tedium associated with it.  By providing authors with good sets of 
candidate documents to investigate, automatically generating accurate 
\bibtex \cite{bibtex} entries and etc, \name makes referencing papers
easy and fun.

The process of building \name necessitated a number of other artifacts 
including the accurate title and reference extractors and document 
matching heuristics...

We evaluated the techniques described using a large corpus of \corpussize
documents from the systems community.  We find that for most papers
\name can successfully determine a good set of references with very
high precision.
