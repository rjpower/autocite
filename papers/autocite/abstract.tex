\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Finding a good set of references for a paper is a critically important 
but tedious task.  Despite the existence of a variety of good academic
search engines (e.g, Google Scholar \cite{scholar}, 
Microsoft Academic Search \cite{ms}, CiteSeer \cite{citeseer}), compiling
a complete and correct set of references for a paper is time-consuming
even for authors well-versed in a field.

Inspired by our own difficulties in this regard, we investigated the
possibility of finding references \it{automatically}.  We evaluated
a variety of text similarity based metrics and heuristics against a 
large document corpus and were able to achieve very good precision/recall
rates for most documents.
